Create a virtual environment by running python -m venv venv and activate it using venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux. After activation, install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the dependencies are installed, start the project by running python app.py, and the Flask server will be live at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
